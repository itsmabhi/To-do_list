# To-do_list
It is a simple project that i implemented when i was trying to learn how to use flask, it is a simple web app that tarcks the task that i need to do.  It has simple functionality of inserting, deleting,and updating a task. It also contains time stamp. I used SQL ALCHEMY library as an ORM for keeping the database.
